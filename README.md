## 💡 Overview  

**Geometry Expressions** is an advanced **symbolic geometry and algebra visualization tool** built to help students, teachers, and researchers explore mathematical concepts interactively. It combines the power of symbolic computation with geometric modeling, creating a unique environment for both learning and analysis.  

The software enables users to **draw geometric figures** that automatically produce **corresponding algebraic equations and constraints**, allowing real-time relationships between geometry and mathematics to be visualized and explored. This makes it an invaluable tool for education, engineering, and scientific modeling.  

**Geometry Expressions** supports a wide range of academic uses — from constructing simple geometric relationships to developing complex symbolic proofs. Users can export models and expressions to external tools such as **Mathematica, Maple**, or **MATLAB**, making it easy to integrate with broader workflows.  

With its intuitive interface, real-time interactivity, and cross-platform compatibility, **Geometry Expressions** transforms geometry into a dynamic, living system — turning static diagrams into interactive mathematical experiments.
